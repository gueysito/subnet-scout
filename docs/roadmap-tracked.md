## ✅ Completed Tasks (as of 2025‑06‑26)
- ✅ Set up project repo (`subnet‑scout`)
- ✅ Build UI skeleton with Tailwind + React + Vite
- ✅ Create working Claude integration with `/ping` endpoint and button
- ✅ Deploy local Express server to handle Claude queries
- ✅ Connect frontend and backend using POST requests
- ✅ Confirm prompt input field updates state and sends request
- ✅ Hook up Claude client with API key using `.env`
- ✅ Test Claude replies (e.g. "what is a Palomino", "what is an Appaloosa")
- ✅ Acquire API keys: io.net, Telegram Bot, TaoStats
- ❌ Test io.net API (network unreachable / wrong endpoint)
- ❌ Test TaoStats v2 endpoint (404 / ENOTFOUND)

- ✅ Successfully test TaoStats **v1** endpoint with pool history  
  (confirmed via `test_tau_v1.js` with sample data)

## 🚧 Tasks To Do (Prep Phase: until June 30)
- ⏳ Create mock data pipeline (simulate subnet data + agent info)
- ⏳ Create core logic flowchart (frontend interaction → scoring algorithm)
- ⏳ Define scoring algorithm (preliminary logic using mocked data)
- ⏳ Create `ScoreAgent` component and dummy output for one subnet
- ⏳ Begin scaffolding Explore UI layout and basic agent list
- ⏳ Begin drafting CoreComms documentation
- ⏳ Begin writing Agent Profiles format (YAML/JSON mock)
- ⏳ Wireframe live dashboard (basic design only)
- ⏳ Write 1‑2 DAO intro posts for Discord

---

## 🔍 Notes
- **io.net API**: still failing due to network/endpoint issues; need to re‑check host or credentials.
- **TaoStats**: main v2 endpoint broken; v1 endpoint works and confirmed. Need to check timeline for v2 availability or fallback.
