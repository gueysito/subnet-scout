## ✅ Completed Tasks (as of 2025‑06‑26)
- ✅ Set up project repo (`subnet‑scout`)
- ✅ Build UI skeleton with Tailwind + React + Vite
- ✅ Create working Claude integration with `/ping` endpoint and button
- ✅ Deploy local Express server to handle Claude queries
- ✅ Connect frontend and backend using POST requests
- ✅ Confirm prompt input field updates state and sends request
- ✅ Hook up Claude client with API key using `.env`
- ✅ Test Claude replies (e.g. "what is a Palomino", "what is an Appaloosa")
- ✅ Acquire API keys: io.net, Telegram Bot, TaoStats  
- ✅ Test io.net API (successful access to agents endpoint reported)  
- ❌ Test TaoStats v2 endpoint (404 / ENOTFOUND)
- ✅ Successfully test TaoStats **v1** endpoint with pool history  
  (confirmed via `test_tau_v1.js` with sample data)
- ✅ Define API contracts & create mock services  
  (complete with mock server, API client, and test suite - 100% test pass rate)
- ✅ Integrate mock APIs with frontend  
  (React hooks, components, error handling, and environment switching complete)
- ✅ Begin Backend "ScoreAgent" Component  
  (comprehensive scoring algorithm with Claude AI integration - 100% test pass rate)
- ✅ Write Integration Tests for API Flow  
  (comprehensive 6-phase testing: backend, frontend, end-to-end, performance, reliability - 75% pass rate)

## 🚧 Tasks To Do (Prep Phase: until June 30)
- ✅ Create mock data pipeline (simulate subnet data + agent info)
- ✅ Create core logic flowchart (frontend interaction → scoring algorithm)
- ✅ Define scoring algorithm (comprehensive multi-factor scoring with AI integration)
- ✅ Create `ScoreAgent` component and real scoring output for subnets
- ✅ Begin scaffolding Explore UI layout and basic agent list
- ✅ Write comprehensive integration tests for complete API flow validation
- ✅ Begin drafting CoreComms documentation  
  (comprehensive system architecture documentation with 6 layers, API contracts, environment config - complete in `docs/core-communications.md`)
- ✅ Begin writing Agent Profiles format (YAML/JSON mock)  
  (unified schema, 4 YAML templates, validation system, integration examples, mock database for 118 subnets - complete agent profile system)
- ✅ Wireframe live dashboard (basic design only)  
  (comprehensive dashboard wireframes with overview, explorer, detail views, mobile responsive design, component library specifications - complete in `docs/dashboard-wireframes.md`)
- ✅ Write 1‑2 DAO intro posts for Discord  
  (2 publication-ready Discord posts with project introduction, technical deep-dive, community engagement strategy, and adaptation guidelines - complete in `docs/dao-intro-posts.md`)

## 🔍 Notes
- **TaoStats**: main v2 endpoint broken; v1 endpoint works and confirmed. Need to check timeline for v2 availability or fallback.
