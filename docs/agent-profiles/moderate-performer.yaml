# === AI ANALYSIS SECTION ===
ai_analysis:
  summary: "Subnet 15 shows moderate performance with room for improvement. While yield is acceptable, the network would benefit from increased validator participation and more consistent activity patterns."
  strengths:
    - "Stable core validator base"
    - "Specialized translation capabilities"
    - "Moderate yield generation"
  concerns:
    - "Lower validator participation than optimal"
    - "Inconsistent activity patterns"
    - "Recent slight yield decline"
    - "Limited community engagement"
  recommendation: "hold"
