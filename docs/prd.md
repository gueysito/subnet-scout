# Subnet Scout Agent – Enhanced Product Requirements Document (PRD)
*Version 2.0 - Enhanced with io.net Integration for Launch IO - Hack 2025 Q2*

## Objective

**Subnet Scout Agent** is an AI-powered monitoring system that tracks and analyzes all Bittensor subnets, providing daily intelligence reports and real-time insights. By leveraging **io.net's decentralized GPU network** and **Intelligence Agent API**, the system can monitor 118+ subnets simultaneously while achieving 90% cost savings compared to traditional cloud solutions.

### Core Value Proposition
The agent transforms subnet monitoring from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, intelligent system that:

* **Monitors All Subnets Simultaneously:** Using io.net's 327,000+ GPU network to track every active Bittensor subnet in parallel, analyzing yield, credibility, and activity metrics in real-time
* **Provides AI-Powered Insights:** Leverages io.net's 25+ AI models to generate intelligent summaries, detect anomalies, and predict trends
* **Delivers Daily Intelligence Reports:** Combines raw metrics with AI analysis to produce actionable insights about subnet performance, validator behavior, and network health
* **Achieves Massive Cost Savings:** Demonstrates 90% reduction in compute costs versus AWS/GCP while providing superior monitoring capabilities

*Why Enhanced?* The original PRD focused on basic monitoring of subnet metrics. This enhanced version leverages io.net's distributed infrastructure to monitor ALL subnets simultaneously (not just top performers) and adds AI-powered analysis that provides predictive insights, not just current state reporting. This positions the project as a comprehensive intelligence platform rather than a simple monitoring tool.
