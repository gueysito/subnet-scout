- `src/test/setup.js` - Global test configuration and mocks
- `vitest.config.js` - Testing framework configuration

### ✅ **Enhanced npm Scripts**
```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
  "test:unit": "vitest run",
  "test:all": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:frontend && npm run test:step4",
  "test:security": "npm audit && npm run lint",
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
}
```

---

## 📝 **TYPESCRIPT FOUNDATION - COMPLETED**

### ✅ **TypeScript Configuration**
- Added `tsconfig.json` with strict mode enabled
- Created `tsconfig.node.json` for build tools
- Configured path mapping for cleaner imports
- Added TypeScript to devDependencies

### ✅ **Comprehensive Type Definitions**
- Created `src/types/index.ts` with 200+ type definitions
- Interface definitions for all major data structures
- API response types with proper error handling
- Component prop types for React components
- AI analysis result types for enhanced scoring

---

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS - COMPLETED**

### ✅ **React Performance Patterns**
- Created `src/utils/performance.js` with optimization utilities
- Added `React.memo` to SubnetCard with custom comparison
- Implemented `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive operations
- Added intersection observer for lazy loading
- Created custom hooks for debouncing and throttling

### ✅ **SubnetCard Component Optimization**
- Memoized configuration objects to prevent recalculation
- Optimized event handlers with useCallback
- Added lazy loading with intersection observer
- Parallel API calls with Promise.allSettled
- Smart caching for extended data fetching

### ✅ **Advanced Performance Utilities**
- Virtual scrolling hook for large lists
- Request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
- Batched state updates for better performance
- Memory monitoring hooks for debugging
- Performance monitoring with render count tracking
