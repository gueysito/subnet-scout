### **üåø GIT WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENT (July 5th)**

**‚úÖ Git History Status:**
- **Previous Milestones**: Committed directly to main with excellent commit messages (tells clear story)
- **July 5 Forward**: ‚úÖ **FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTED** - All future development uses feature branches
- **Current History**: Professional and hackathon-ready (kept as-is for stability)

**üîÑ New Development Process:**
1. Create feature branch: `feature/milestone-name`
2. Develop and test on branch
3. Commit with comprehensive message
4. Push branch to GitHub
5. Merge to main only when ready
6. Clean, organized progress tracking for judges

### **üöÄ IO.NET INTELLIGENCE PRIORITY - FIXED (July 5th)**

**‚úÖ Critical Priority Fix Implemented:**

**Problem**: Frontend and Telegram bot were using basic `/api/score` (Anthropic primary) instead of `/api/score/enhanced` (io.net primary)

**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Telegram Bot**: Updated both `/analyze` and `/compare` commands to use `/api/score/enhanced`
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Components**: Updated `ScoreAgentDemo.jsx` to use enhanced endpoint
- ‚úÖ **API Client**: Updated `calculateScore()` method to use enhanced endpoint
- ‚úÖ **Mock Server**: Added `/api/score/enhanced` endpoint for testing

**üéØ NEW PRIORITY ORDER (ENFORCED):**
1. **Primary**: `/api/score/enhanced` (io.net intelligence + EnhancedScoreAgent)
2. **Fallback**: `/api/score` (Anthropic Claude + ScoreAgent)

**Enhancement Options Now Enabled:**
- `include_ai_insights: true`
- `risk_assessment: true` 
- `market_analysis: true`

**‚ö†Ô∏è FUTURE DEVELOPMENT RULES:**
1. **API Priority**: ALWAYS use `/api/score/enhanced` for user-facing features. Basic `/api/score` is only for fallback/legacy support.
2. **Git Workflow**: üåø **MANDATORY FEATURE BRANCHES** - All future commits must use feature branches before merging to main. No direct commits to main.
