### **üåø GIT WORKFLOW ENHANCEMENT (July 5th)**

**‚úÖ Git History Status:**
- **Previous Milestones**: Committed directly to main with excellent commit messages (tells clear story)
- **July 5 Forward**: ‚úÖ **FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTED** - All future development uses feature branches
- **Current History**: Professional and hackathon-ready (kept as-is for stability)

**üîÑ New Development Process:**
1. Create feature branch: `feature/milestone-name`
2. Develop and test on branch
3. Commit with comprehensive message
4. Push branch to GitHub
5. Merge to main only when ready
6. Clean, organized progress tracking for judges

### **üöÄ IO.NET INTELLIGENCE PRIORITY - FIXED (July 5th)**

**‚úÖ Critical Priority Fix Implemented:**

**Problem**: Frontend and Telegram bot were using basic `/api/score` (Anthropic primary) instead of `/api/score/enhanced` (io.net primary)

**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Telegram Bot**: Updated both `/analyze` and `/compare` commands to use `/api/score/enhanced`
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Components**: Updated `ScoreAgentDemo.jsx` to use enhanced endpoint
- ‚úÖ **API Client**: Updated `calculateScore()` method to use enhanced endpoint
- ‚úÖ **Mock Server**: Added `/api/score/enhanced` endpoint for testing

**üéØ NEW PRIORITY ORDER (ENFORCED):**
1. **Primary**: `/api/score/enhanced` (io.net intelligence + EnhancedScoreAgent)
2. **Fallback**: `/api/score` (Anthropic Claude + ScoreAgent)

**Enhancement Options Now Enabled:**
- `include_ai_insights: true`
- `risk_assessment: true` 
- `market_analysis: true`

**‚ö†Ô∏è FUTURE DEVELOPMENT RULES:**
1. **API Priority**: ALWAYS use `/api/score/enhanced` for user-facing features. Basic `/api/score` is only for fallback/legacy support.
2. **Git Workflow**: üåø **MANDATORY FEATURE BRANCHES** - All future commits must use feature branches before merging to main. No direct commits to main.

*Last Updated: July 5, 2025 - Advanced Filters & Search Implementation Completed Successfully*

## üö® **CRITICAL: PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKLIST**

### **üéØ SWITCH TO LIVE ETHOS DATA BEFORE FINAL DEMO**

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Kaito Yaps**: Already using live data from public API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethos Network**: Currently using mock tokens in testing (conservative approach)

**Pre-Submission Action Required:**
- [ ] **Configure Real Privy Credentials** in `.env` file:
  ```
  PRIVY_APP_ID=cmcmkl9c600mvl80nk0tnv1ri
  PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=client-WY6N4nSV41TBQ4JpMZ5NdVzyoukgfJfUgurxb5o44rJSn
  PRIVY_APP_SECRET=3ngmexA8iP4rj9TkcqKRUjwVw9WmHYRka32FvnMFbW9GhfBs4gSTNdJJPUjyEciCdoxeT1HSYBpM66dGcuumD14x
  ```
- [ ] **Test Real Authentication** with actual Ethos profiles
- [ ] **Verify Token Usage** stays within 150 user limit
- [ ] **Update Test Suite** to use real tokens for final validation

**Why We're Conservative Now:**
- **150 User Limit**: Preserving API calls for actual hackathon demonstration
- **Testing Safety**: Mock tokens verify auth logic without consuming real usage
- **Production Readiness**: Want full token availability for judges' testing

**Hackathon Demo Impact:**
- **Real Identity Verification**: Show actual Ethos profiles and reputation scores
- **Live Authentication**: Demonstrate real Privy integration working
- **Full Platform Demo**: Both Kaito (live) + Ethos (live) operational

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMINDER**: Switch to live Ethos credentials **24-48 hours before submission** to ensure full functionality during judging period.
