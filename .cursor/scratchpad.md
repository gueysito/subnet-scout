# Subnet Scout Project - CoreComms Documentation Task

## Background and Motivation

**Current Status:** Pre-hackathon preparation phase (4 tasks remaining before June 30)

**Task Focus:** Create comprehensive CoreComms (Core Communications) documentation that maps out how all system components communicate with each other.

**Why This Matters:**
- The system has evolved to include multiple layers: Frontend (React) → API Client → Backend (Express) → Scoring Engine (ScoreAgent) → External APIs (io.net, TaoStats, Claude)
- Team members and future contributors need clear documentation of data flows, API contracts, and integration patterns
- Critical for debugging, maintenance, and scaling during hackathon development phase
- Establishes foundation for more complex features like real-time monitoring and batch processing

**System Architecture Overview:**
```
Frontend (React + Vite)
    ↓ (HTTP requests)
API Client (apiClient.js) 
    ↓ (Environment switching: Mock/Real)
Backend Server (pingAgent.js - Express)
    ↓ (Integration calls)
Scoring Engine (ScoreAgent.js + Claude AI)
    ↓ (External API calls)
External Services (io.net, TaoStats, Telegram)
    ↓ (Mock during development)
Mock Server (mock-server.js)
```

**Previous Task Completed:** ✅ Step 1: CoreComms Documentation (5/5 tasks completed)
- Successfully delivered 1,100+ lines of comprehensive system documentation
- Documented complete architecture, API contracts, environment setup, integration patterns, and user workflows
- Established foundation for efficient development and team coordination

**Current Task:** Step 2: Agent Profiles Format (YAML/JSON mock)
**Context:** According to roadmap-tracked.md, this is the next hackathon prep task before the July 1 build phase begins.

**Business Need:** The Subnet Scout system currently has multiple data structures for agent/subnet information across different layers (frontend display, backend scoring, mock data, external APIs), but lacks a **standardized Agent Profile format** for:
- **Data Exchange:** Standard format for sharing agent profiles between systems and teams
- **Configuration Management:** Profile templates for different subnet agent types and validator categories
- **Validation & Quality Control:** Schema definitions ensuring data consistency across development and production
- **Documentation & Discovery:** Human-readable profiles that make agent characteristics accessible to stakeholders
- **Integration Readiness:** Unified format supporting io.net's 327K+ GPU network and Claude AI analysis integration

**Problem Statement:** Current data structures are fragmented across components with no unified schema, making it difficult to onboard new agents, validate data consistency, or provide comprehensive agent documentation for the hackathon demo.

---

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. **Multi-Layer Communication Complexity**
- Frontend uses custom React hooks (useApi, useSubnetAgents, useSubnetScore, useApiHealth)
- API Client switches between mock and real endpoints based on environment flags
- Backend orchestrates scoring calculations and external API integrations
- ScoreAgent integrates with Claude AI for intelligent analysis

### 2. **Environment Management**
- Development mode uses mock server (localhost:3001) 
- Production mode uses real external APIs with authentication
- Seamless environment switching requires clear documentation of all endpoints and data contracts

### 3. **Error Handling Patterns**
- Each layer has different error handling strategies
- Need to document error propagation from external APIs → backend → API client → frontend components
- Mock server simulates various error scenarios for testing

### 4. **Data Flow Complexity**
- Real-time subnet data flows through multiple transformations
- Scoring calculations require data from multiple sources (TaoStats + io.net + AI analysis)
- Frontend components need to handle loading states, error states, and data updates

### Technical Architecture Analysis

**Current Data Structure Landscape:**
1. **Frontend Display Format** (SubnetCard.jsx): Basic UI-focused fields (subnet_id, name, status, score, yield, activity, credibility)
2. **Backend Scoring Format** (ScoreAgent.js): Comprehensive analysis output with AI summaries and calculation details
3. **Mock Server Format** (mock-server.js): Development testing data with realistic but simplified structures
4. **External API Formats** (TaoStats, io.net): Raw metrics and GPU agent data with varying schemas

**Key Integration Challenges:**
- **Schema Inconsistency:** Different components use different field names and data types for similar concepts
- **Data Completeness:** No single format captures the full agent lifecycle from raw metrics → scoring → AI analysis → UI display
- **Validation Gaps:** No standard validation or required field definitions across the system
- **Documentation Deficit:** No human-readable format for explaining agent profiles to stakeholders
- **Extensibility Limits:** Current structures not designed for future agent types or expanded metric categories

### Stakeholder Requirements Analysis

**Primary Users Needing Agent Profiles:**
1. **Developers:** Need standardized schemas for consistent implementation across frontend/backend
2. **DevOps Teams:** Need deployment-ready configurations and validation schemas
3. **Hackathon Judges:** Need clear, professional documentation of agent capabilities and performance
4. **Future Team Members:** Need onboarding documentation explaining agent types and characteristics

**Success Criteria Definition:**
- **Comprehensive Schema:** Single format covering all agent data from identity → performance → AI insights
- **Multi-Format Support:** Both YAML (human-readable) and JSON (machine-readable) versions
- **Validation Ready:** Include schemas that can validate data integrity
- **Documentation Quality:** Professional, clear explanations suitable for hackathon presentation
- **Integration Patterns:** Examples showing how to use profiles across different system components
